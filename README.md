### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm alisyahrizal

I have been an active validator for several years and always try to keep the leading positions in the tops of such projects as: SEI, ASSETMANTLE, REBUS, Starknet, Subspace Network, Aptos. I try to keep the node up and running. After reading the documents on the project, I was very intrigued by it. I know several programming languages, which helps me in my work.

I also took the roles of SEI - active testnet validator, ASSETMANTLE - active mainnet validator, REBUS - active mainnet validator, Starknet - contributor, Subspace Network - active testnet validator also Ambassador, Aptos - active testnet validator also Ambassador.
Participated in stress tests of the Aptos network on the Starknet Subspace Network to achieve node stability. Participated in the Aptos and Subspace Ambassador programs, moderated the community
